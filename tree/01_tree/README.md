# 01 Tree

This problem can be found here: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1919/D

There are multiple files here, it's me attempting to solve it. The tree_final.cpp is the file
with the actual solution.

inp.txt file contains test inputs, you can run the script with 
`./a.out < inp.txt` to test it.
